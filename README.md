Here is where I learn about DALEX package.
# learning DALEX package

I am doctroal student where I have learned most of statistic skills in SPSS.
SPSS is a great software, but there are limitations. During my statistic classes I have had a chance to learning about R.  The title of the class had been "advanced statistics" and it was a kind of "advanced" calss in a sense. R can do a lot more other things than SPSS at 2017~2018.  So there has been benefit that I can take if I can do all the statistic inferences in R instead of SPSS. So it was beginning of my story to learn about R more seriously.

And I have learned so many machine learning skills, deep learning skills in R.  And I have discovered there also are a lot more things we need to do in R and AI world because of the complexity of understanding about the logic of machine learning algorithm.  That's why I love to contribute my time to learning and practice about DALEX.  My background is corporeate learning. Therefore this area, "explanable AI" is more attractive to me.

DALEX The DALEX package (Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations) helps to understand how complex models are working. The main function explain() creates a wrapper around a predictive model. Wrapped models may then be explored and compared with a collection of local and global explainers. Recent developents from the area of Interpretable Machine Learning/eXplainable Artificial Intelligence.

The philosophy behind DALEX explanations is described in the Predictive Models: Explore, Explain, and Debug e-book. The DALEX package is a part of DrWhy.AI universe.
